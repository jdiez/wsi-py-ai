## Security Best Practices

This project follows these security practices:

- Dependencies are regularly audited via `deptry` and Dependabot
- Pre-commit hooks detect private keys and debug statements
- All code is linted with `ruff` including `flake8-bandit` security rules
- Type checking via `mypy` in strict mode reduces runtime errors
